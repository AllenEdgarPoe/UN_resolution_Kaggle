# UN_resolution_Kaggle <br>
I analysized "yes_vote" per states in UN general Assembly resolution. <br>

## Library 
```
import os
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot
import plotly.graph_objs as go
```

It turned out that western countries like US, European cast more "no" votes than Asia, African countries.
